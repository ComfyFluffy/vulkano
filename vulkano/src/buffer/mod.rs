//! Location in memory that contains data.
//!
//! A Vulkan buffer is very similar to a buffer that you would use in programming languages in
//! general, in the sense that it is a location in memory that contains data. The difference
//! between a Vulkan buffer and a regular buffer is that the content of a Vulkan buffer is
//! accessible from the GPU.
//!
//! Vulkano does not perform any specific marshalling of buffer data. The representation of the
//! buffer in memory is identical between the CPU and GPU. Because the Rust compiler is allowed to
//! reorder struct fields at will by default when using `#[repr(Rust)]`, it is advised to mark each
//! struct requiring input assembly as `#[repr(C)]`. This forces Rust to follow the standard C
//! procedure. Each element is laid out in memory in the order of declaration and aligned to a
//! multiple of their alignment.
//!
//! # Multiple levels of abstraction
//!
//! - The low-level implementation of a buffer is [`RawBuffer`], which corresponds directly to a
//!   `VkBuffer`, and as such doesn't hold onto any memory.
//! - [`Buffer`] is a `RawBuffer` with memory bound to it, and with state tracking.
//! - [`Subbuffer`] is what you will use most of the time, as it is what all the APIs expect. It is
//!   a reference to a portion of a `Buffer`. `Subbuffer` also has a type parameter, which is a
//!   hint for how the data in the portion of the buffer is going to be interpreted.
//!
//! # `Subbuffer` allocation
//!
//! There are two ways to get a `Subbuffer`:
//!
//! - By using the functions on `Buffer`, which create a new buffer and memory allocation each
//!   time, and give you a `Subbuffer` that has an entire `Buffer` dedicated to it.
//! - By using the [`SubbufferAllocator`], which creates `Subbuffer`s by suballocating existing
//!   `Buffer`s such that the `Buffer`s can keep being reused.
//!
//! Which of these you should choose depends on the use case. For example, if you need to upload
//! data to the device each frame, then you should use `SubbufferAllocator`. Same goes for if you
//! need to download data very frequently, or if you need to allocate a lot of intermediary buffers
//! that are only accessed by the device. On the other hand, if you need to upload some data just
//! once, or you can keep reusing the same buffer (because its size is unchanging) it's best to
//! use a dedicated `Buffer` for that.
//!
//! # Buffer usage
//!
//! When you create a buffer, you have to specify its *usage*. In other words, you have to
//! specify the way it is going to be used. Trying to use a buffer in a way that wasn't specified
//! when you created it will result in a runtime error.
//!
//! You can use buffers for the following purposes:
//!
//! - Can contain arbitrary data that can be transferred from/to other buffers and images.
//! - Can be read and modified from a shader.
//! - Can be used as a source of vertices and indices.
//! - Can be used as a source of list of models for draw indirect commands.
//!
//! Accessing a buffer from a shader can be done in the following ways:
//!
//! - As a uniform buffer. Uniform buffers are read-only.
//! - As a storage buffer. Storage buffers can be read and written.
//! - As a uniform texel buffer. Contrary to a uniform buffer, the data is interpreted by the GPU
//!   and can be for example normalized.
//! - As a storage texel buffer. Additionally, some data formats can be modified with atomic
//!   operations.
//!
//! Using uniform/storage texel buffers requires creating a *buffer view*. See [the `view` module]
//! for how to create a buffer view.
//!
//! See also [the `shader` module documentation] for information about how buffer contents need to
//! be laid out in accordance with the shader interface.
